            City Slicker is a fast-paced, movement-based first-person shooter that I developed completely on my 
            own over the course of five weeks using Unity and C#. 
            The game uses no external libraries, packages, or assets, 
            everything from the mechanics to the visuals was built from scratch.

            City Slicker is a movement based fps where the player needs to build up speed to jump from building to building while eliminating dangerous turrets and avoiding traps. My focus was to make the movement feel fast, fluid, reliable and fun! Making the player eager to maintain a high speed despite its risks.
            The development of this game taught me a lot about the basics of OOP, for example: polymorphism, Encapsulation, and inheritance. The development also taught me about the importance of modular and easily reusable code.
            During development, I ran into several issues with Unity’s built-in Animator system. After a lot of trial and error, I decided to drop it entirely and trigger animations manually through code. This ended up being much more reliable and gave me more control.
